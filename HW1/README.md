# Homework 1: Bird Images Classification

## How to Train

1. Unzip the `training_images` and `testing_images` folders into the same directory as `Traincode.ipynb`.
2. Install the packages in `requirements.txt`  by the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Setup a jupyter notebook server (`jupyter notebook` on command line) that covers the directory of where `Traincode.ipynb` is.
4. Run all cells in the `Traincode.ipynb` notebook in order.
5. The model state_dict file will be generated as `resnet50.pt`

## How to Test

1. Make sure that `classes.txt` , `sample_answer.txt`  and `resnet50.pt` exist in the same directory as `Testcode.ipynb`. The `sample_answer.txt` is provided for ordering of filenames.
2. Install the packages in `requirements.txt`  by the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Setup a jupyter notebook server (`jupyter notebook` on command line) that covers the directory of where `Testcode.ipynb` is.
4. Run all cells in the `Testcode.ipynb` notebook in order.
5. The answer labels will be generated as `ans.txt`.
6. Zip the file into `ans.zip` to upload to CodaLab.
