## How to Train

1. Setup a jupyter notebook server (`jupyter notebook` on command line) that covers the directory of where `train.ipynb` is.
4. Run all cells in the `train.ipynb` notebook in order.
5. The final weight file will be generated as `results/epoch_20.pth`.

## How to Test

1. Run the `inference.ipynb` [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G6LpoICR5U50zWHRisK8loYDCgyLh9vF?usp=sharing).
2. Download the generated `ans.json`.
6. Zip the file into `ans.zip` and upload to CodaLab.
